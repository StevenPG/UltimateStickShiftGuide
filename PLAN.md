# Plan

I want to create an updated and more impressive version of my StickShiftMaster website.

The code is available here: https://github.com/StevenPG/StickShiftMaster/tree/main

The goal is to help people learn how to drive stick shift with one simple resource.

It should have the following features:

- Modern and responsive design
- Improved user interface and user experience
- visual RPM gauge that responds to user input
- Information sections about stick shift driving techniques
- github actions workflow to execute wrangler build and deploy on main branch push

I included a photo called img.png that includes the components that I need recreated but better.

It includes the following:

- the rpm simulation with gear selection
- transmission ratios
- vehicle parameters
- current calculation for RPM based on speed, gear, axle gear ratio and tire diameter

I want to use modern web technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, and D3.js for the visualizations.

Ask me questions and interview about the site. I want it to look very professional and polished.
